# piratebattleships

derivative work from: http://code.google.com/p/piratebattleships/

It remains a windows forms based battleships game with network support for 2 players
It was developed in C# under Visual Studio and depends on the .Net Framework 3.5

I have (not being a programmer) managed to get it to compile and run under SharpDevelop.

Before it only looked right on Windows XP systems with certain resolutions/dpi. It was very
much not playable. I decided since it is open source (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
I would poke around and see what I could do. I might actually be learning something as it now compiles
and runs on my Windows 7 machine as well as an XP system in a VirtualPC.

It still has many bugs and from what I can see was written as a school project by a group of German
programmers. It hasn't been touched for years but it is the best free LAN version of Battleship I have found.
